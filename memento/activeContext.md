# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Configured Serilog for structured logging with correlation IDs in `Program.cs`.
- Added `CorrelationIdMiddleware` to generate and propagate correlation IDs.
- Updated `NotificationService` to accept `IHttpContextAccessor` and include correlation IDs in HTTP request headers.

## Recent Changes
- Modified `Program.cs` to register `IHttpContextAccessor` and `CorrelationIdMiddleware`.
- Created `CorrelationIdMiddleware.cs` to handle correlation IDs.
- Updated `NotificationService.cs` to include `IHttpContextAccessor` and modify `SendNotificationAsync` to add correlation IDs to HTTP headers.

## Next Steps
- Verify that the correlation ID is correctly propagated between services.
- Test the logging to ensure that correlation IDs are included in log entries.
- Update other services to ensure they also propagate correlation IDs.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose Serilog for structured logging.
- Implemented middleware to manage correlation IDs.
- Ensured that `IHttpContextAccessor` is registered and injected into `NotificationService`.
